# [Angular Tour of Heroes using QuickStart seed project](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes) + gulp for distribution
  
This project focuses on gulp distribution of an Angular Tour of Heroes web app that was created while following the [Angular's Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/). My version of Tour of Heroes is [located here on github](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes) for comparison.

The changes made to this project are all described in detail in my other project: [Angular 2 QuickStart seed project + gulp for distribution](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular-2-Quickstart-Gulp). Note: It is very possible that this project will begin fall behind as that other project is updated so, my recommendation is to use the other project as a starting point and begin to manually make changes to your own Tour of Heroes project. Also note that the src/Web.config file exists here because I distribute to a Windows server where .Net conflicts with Angular routing. Hope this helps you to get up and running faster.
