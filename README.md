# [Angular Tour of Heroes using QuickStart seed project](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes) + gulp for distribution
  
This project focuses on gulp distribution of an Angular Tour of Heroes web app ([located here on github for comparison](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes)) that was created while following the [Angular's Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/).

For now I like using the [Angular quickstart (seed project)](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) for development. I'd like to use it as is. It already has linting, karma and e2e set up. But, the quickstart project does not have any way of generating a dist folder for easily distributing a production build. So, this project aims to stay out of the way of the Angular Quickstart 'src' folder when generating a 'dist' folder. You have my [other project](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes) to compare to before this additional of gulp was made.  
  
## Files that were modified:
- [package.json](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes_Gulp/blob/master/tutorial/package.json) ([old version for comparison](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes/blob/master/tutorial/package.json)) <-- added new scripts for dist build and run with watch (in tutorial directory run `npm run startdist` script). The additional scripts are trivial and don't have to be reused but, there were also additional packages installed and saved to the project as devDependencies that should install when you run `npm start`. Those packages are needed for gulp. For details of those required packages refer to [this tutorial by Colin Eberhardt](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/12/24/creating-an-angular-2-build.html).    
   
## Files that were created:
- [bs-config.dist.json](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes_Gulp/blob/master/tutorial/bs-config.dist.json)  <-- used in new package.json script to use 'dist' instead of 'src' folder during prod build
- [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/BumbleB2na/Angular_Tour-of-Heroes_Gulp/blob/master/tutorial/gulpfile.js)  <-- used to compile and copy files from  (in tutorial directory run `gulp`)  
  
# To use (Windows):
1. `cd tutorial`  <-- this project does not sit at the root
2. `npm install`  <-- devDependency packages install to node_modules in your project folder
3. `gulp`  <-- builds to dist folder
4. `npm run startdist`  <-- runs and watches the dist build, like it is done with src (dev) build in Quickstart Seed package.json script
5. ftp dist folder contents to server location  (manually update base href in index.html to match folder location on server)
  
To help integrate gulp I followed [this tutorial by Colin Eberhardt](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/12/24/creating-an-angular-2-build.html) but used a different base project. Refer to it for more explanation of some of the concepts used here. Unlike the tutorial my base project is based off of Angular 2 Quickstart Seed project and I don't want the gulp process to do as much so that I can further separate dev from dist. I don't need to set up a linter in gulp on dist build because, the quickstart project already has linting set up on the dev build. I like to use the dev build as-is.  
  
I've diverged a bit from that tutorial and changed my dev and dist strategy as follows: 
- do all linting and testing on development build
- distribution build can be ran and watched same as development build to verify that it works before moving to server  
  
## Gulp default task:
1. Compiles src/app TypeScript files  (src is development folder)
2. Cleans dist directory  (dist is distribution folder)
3. Copies src/ and src/app files to the dist directory. Do not copy TypeScript files or spec files used for Karma tests on dev.  
4. Copies the minimum node\_modules .js files to dist/node_modules directory to be used by distribution  
  
# Planned updates:
1. Todo: figure out how to include a small, compiled version of rxjs in the dist build
2. Todo: use webpack to make a lighter-weight dist build  
3. Considering: upgrading above Angular 2
